FLATDANGO MOVIE SITE

This project is a fairly simple concept, it is one where the user can look through a variety of movies and click to book a ticket. The project uses java, css and html.

the html is used as the project runs on a webpage.

HOW FLATDANGO WORKS

The project allows you to search from the collection of movies on the page so that you can book for the film you wish to watch.

The projects functionality is not optimal as the avilable tickets do not update visibly, however you are alerted on the number of available tickets after each purchase of a ticket
